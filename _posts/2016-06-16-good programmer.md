HOW CAN I BECOME A GOOD PROGRAMMER?

“Everybody in the country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think”
Steve jobs

Programming is basically explaining to computer what you want it to do for you.

Why should we code? Fifty-five percent of all jobs include computer programming, and the percentage rate is set to grow thirty percent by 2020. If one tries learning computer programming, he or she may like it and and interest grows if a person likes it. 

Most people think computer programming is just a fun thing to do, but it actually has to do with just about anything related to a computer. For instance, a programmer uses HTML, a coding language, to  construct a website.Programming can be intimidating and viewed in the perspective way that only the genius can do it but, it is something that can be learnt.

In the current world, there are a lot of people who are computer scientist and software developers graduates but look at the number of the jobless and those who have got the job or qualifies for a job is only around 35%..so how do we start?

Determination:
You don't have to be genius to how how to code or program but only just have this thing called determination, be determined or what you want to do and be a genius to read and do math.

Aim:

Also you should have an aim of why are you doing what you are doing, are doing doing it for money or to change world? It is always said 'programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future' .

Willingness to research:

Technology is always evolving and both skills and abilities a programmer has today will likely be outdated in a few years, so a good programmer thrives on finding ways to make something work and doing more research to know whats new and what has changed in the world of technology concerning programming.

Passion:

Programming can be extremely stressful profession when deadlines are tight and nothing seems to be working so you should be passionate about it for you to keep working else you might end up giving up.


Laziness:

Laziness may sound like a bad trait but if you want to find the best way to do something, then ask a lazy person. Good programmers are not lazy at all since programming world doesn't favor lazy programmers , be an hardworking person who is ready to change the world and ever willing to work and have the ability to plan and first design his/her work before starting to write down a piece of code for you to be really good in programming.

Ability to handle future:

Programmers rarely get everything on the first try, infact failure is almost a certainty. It is good to see errors and bugs as a challenge rather than a sign of defeat. Persistence is important.


Teamwork:

Programmers rarely work alone even if he/she is the only developer in a company. The value of teamwork is regularly seen in sports. How often do we see teams made up of expensive star players outperformed by teams with players who may be individually less talented. Assuming transfer price tags really are an indicator of talent! The answer lies in two things. The synergistic value of teamwork (our glue and oil), and in the crucial role of the manager.


A lot has been discussed above but in addition, enrolling in boot camps do contribute much to the programming competencies. Join Moringa School, as it is one of the best place for passionate and determined programmers to be.


“Any fool can write a code that a computer can understand but good programmers writes a code that humans can understand”   Martin Fowler
